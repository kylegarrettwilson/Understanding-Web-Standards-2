              Here is a product statement directly from Martin:<br>
              <br>
              "The early Martin guitars were totally hand-crafted products, made on a one-by-one basis, and
              there was little standardization. However, there were a few features that commonly incorporated
              in most of C. F. Martin’s instruments. Until the mid-1840s, Martin guitars were characterized
              by a headstock that had all the tuning keys on one side. Martin acquired this design from his
              teacher in Vienna, Johann Stauffer. The headstock design with all the tuning keys on one side
              was discontinued by Martin and went unused until Leo Fender resurrected the design in 1948 with
              his Telecaster guitar."
