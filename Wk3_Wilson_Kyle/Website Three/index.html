                        <br>
                        "The early Martin guitars were totally hand-crafted products, made on a one-by-one basis, and
                        there was little standardization. However, there were a few features that commonly incorporated
                        in most of C. F. Martin’s instruments. Until the mid-1840s, Martin guitars were characterized
                        by a headstock that had all the tuning keys on one side. Martin acquired this design from his
                        teacher in Vienna, Johann Stauffer. The headstock design with all the tuning keys on one side
                        was discontinued by Martin and went unused until Leo Fender resurrected the design in 1948 with
                        his Telecaster guitar."
