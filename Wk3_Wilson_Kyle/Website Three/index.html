                    <p> <strong>Rock climbing </strong> is a great workout for the thrill seeker in you. We have a professional
                        team that is trained in every type of rock climbing there is. If you are afraid of heights this can
                        be a great way to over come your fears and embrace the adventure! We ask that all of our climbers
                        take a one hour course on safety no matter what your skill level may be. This is to ensure we all have
                        a great time and can focus on the adrenaline rush without fear of failing to do something correctly.

                    <p> <strong>White water rafting </strong> is a absolute blast for any thrill seeker! We have a variety of
                        courses that are available to the brave hearted. The beginning course simply has some obstacles and
                        the least amount of fierce water. The second and third routes progressively get more intense and have a
                        higher risk of rolling over. As with rock climbing, we have a one hour course that everyone must take.

                    <p> <strong>Skydiving </strong>is the more intense activity we offer. With the added thrill comes added danger.
                        All of our jump instructors are qualified to rescue in case of an emergency. We must ask you to sign a
                        release waver for this activity. The class is three hours long and will go over proper jump procedures and
                        what to do in case of an emergency.
